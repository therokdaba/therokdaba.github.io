First thing I did was check the site's source page but sadly it didn't give out any flag or any interesting information. So I then took a look at Firefox's Web Developer Tools. 

There I found a flag cookie with a value of `0` (*Storage->Cookies->https://ringzer0ctf.com*). I then changed its value to 1 and reloaded the page...and voil√† the flag is now displayed instead of the previous text!
