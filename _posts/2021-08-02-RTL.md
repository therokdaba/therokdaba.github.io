# RTL CTF 2021

I want to first start out by thanking the organizers for this great CTF. I had a lot of fun playing with my team `cyb3r_w1z4rd5`.

## Bites
Bites was a reversing challenge in RTL CTF worth 50 points.

We are given two files (I put them at the [end of this section](#annex) if you want to see them): `dc9_bites.txt` and `flag.txt`.

The first file is the one we need to reverse and what it does is the following:

1. Saves 'w' in variable named `key`
2. Splits a variable named `cipher` in a list called `a` -> we do not know what cipher contains but we can guess that it's the ascii code of the flag's characters.
3. Saves the ascii code of `key` (119) in a variable named `key_1`.
4. Saves the hex value of `key` (77) in a variable named `key_2`
5. Saves `key_1` and `key_2` in a list called `keyes`.
6. Executes a for loop that does that basically following:
   
   1. if the for loop's `index` is even: it saves the xor of `key_2` and `a[index]` in `cipher`
   2. if the for loop's `index` is odd: it saves the xor of `key_1` and `a[index]` in `cipher`
7. Saves `cipher` in the file flag.txt

So we can now write the following script to get the flag:

```python
file = open("flag.txt", "r")
#get all 15 numbers in an array
for line in file:
    elements = line.split(' ')

keyes = [119, 77]
chars = []

for i in range(len(elements)):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        chars.append(chr(int(elements[i])^keyes[1]))
    else:
        chars.append(chr(int(elements[i])^keyes[0]))
flag = ''.join(chars)
print(flag)
```
We get the following flag: `RTL{H4x_ByT3$$}`.

## Triangle
This challenge was part of the Crypto section of this CTF and was worth 10 points.

We are given the following: `133f29027034094a33253126395b3704` and are told that it was encrypted with a 4 byte key, meaning 4 characters. 

I basically just bruteforced this challenge, so that I could work on other challenges in the meantime, with the following script: 

```python 
import string
def hex_xor(hex_a, hex_b):
    return hex(int(hex_a, 16) ^ int(hex_b, 16))[2:]

def xor_solver(string, string_key):
    new_key = '' 
    decryption = ''

    # Repeat key in new_key for as long as hex_string is
    for i in range(0, round(len(hex_string)/2), 1):
        new_key += hex(ord(string_key[i % len(string_key)]))[2:]

    # Perform xor on both hex
    xor_result = hex_xor(hex_string, new_key)

    # Convert the hex to char
    for j in range(0, len(xor_result)-1, 2):
        decryption += chr(int(xor_result[j]+xor_result[j+1], 16))

    return decryption

value = '133f29027034094a33253126395b3704'
flags = []
for i in string.printable:
    for j in string.printable:
        for k in string.printable:
            for l in string.printable:
                print(f"Trying: {i}{j}{k}{l}")
                result = xor_solver(value, f"{i}{j}{k}{l}")
                if "RTL{" in result:
                    print(f"\n{result} is a possible flag!!!!\n")
                    flags.append(result)
print(flags)
```
I got the following flag: `RTL{1_l3rNT_x0R}`.

## Last Words
This challenge was part of the Crypto section of this CTF and was worth 50 points.

We were given values for `n`,`e` and `c`, meaning that it was a RSA challenge.

The first thing I did is run `n` in [http://factordb.com/](http://factordb.com/) and there I learned that `n` was equal to a certain number `p`(this number figures in my script I'm not putting it here because it would be too long) power 3. So `n=p^3`. 

This changes the way we need to calculate `phi`, I found this article, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function#Value_of_phi_for_a_prime_power_argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function#Value_of_phi_for_a_prime_power_argument), that tells us that `phi` is now equal to `p^2*(p-1)`. 

We can now put it in our script and solve it like a basic RSA. Note: if you are unfamiliar with basic RSA ctf challenges, the following video by John Hammond is a good introduction on how to solve these challenges: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INOjNotyLjA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INOjNotyLjA).

This is the final script:

```python

```

The flag is the following: `RTL{1_c0uld_pr0b4bly_m4k3_th15_al0t_h4rd3r_next_t1m3!!!-e82fac7a780f72579c47b6ce0d5b7fd82eb6192ed65949ca485309b5}`

## Diffie-Hellman
This challenge was part of the Crypto section of this CTF and was worth 100 points. 

It was a MITM (Man in the middle) attack. We were listening in on Bob and Alice exchanging their keys, following the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, and Bob finally sends the flag encrypted using this shared key. If we send in `0` disguising ourselves as Alice, Bob's sends the flag in an unencrypted format and we get the following: `RTL{4c7d928f563796fbe0d5f1d094c348b5}`.

## Red
Red was an OSINT challenge released later in the CTF worth 40 points. We are told that Railan Jareth is the sysadmin of a company and we need to find out which company it is, the version of their current windows server and the name of their server.

The first thing I did is look up this man on Linkedin and there I found his profile: [https://ro.linkedin.com/in/railan-jareth-10a800218](https://ro.linkedin.com/in/railan-jareth-10a800218). This told me that he worked at `HackArmour` and also linked me to his twitter: [https://twitter.com/5C3P73R5PH1NX/](https://twitter.com/5C3P73R5PH1NX/).

There was nothing interesting on his twitter so I decided to run `sherlock` on his twitter handle, `5C3P73R5PH1NX` and I found his reddit [https://www.reddit.com/user/5C3P73R5PH1NX](https://www.reddit.com/user/5C3P73R5PH1NX).

On his reddit, I found out their Windows Server version was `2016` and that their server was `DL360`.

The final flag was: `RTL{HackArmour_2016_DL360}`
## Thanks for Playing
Thanks for playing was an OSINT challenge released towards the end of the CTF worth 5 points. We are told that the CTF organisers left a note on twitter with the following hashtag: `#RTLxHA`. 

The first thing I did was looking up this hashtag on twitter and I found the following tweet: [https://twitter.com/d4rckh/status/1421816732860157956](https://twitter.com/d4rckh/status/1421816732860157956).

This tweet lead me to the [rtl-ctf.hackarmour.tech/secret](rtl-ctf.hackarmour.tech/secret) where lied the flag: `RTL{TH4NK2_F0R_PL4Y1NG}`
## Where is this?
Where is this? was an OSINT challenge released later in the ctf worth 40 points. We are given an image and need to find its coordinates rounded to 3 decimal places.

The image is the following:

![*image from the ctf*](/images/Where/where.PNG)


If we zoom in on the left, we can kind of make out the words "Zum Padd", I started typing it out on my search bar and was automatically recommended Zum Paddenwirt. I checked it out on Google Maps and found there its coordinates.

The flag was: `RTL{52.517_13.409}`.

## Expic
Expic was a forensics challenge worth 15 points. We are given an image and need to find the flag hidden in it. 

The first thing to is run `exiftool` on this image (Syntax: `exiftool photo`) and we find something that looks really interesting: a number -> `68747470733a2f2f706173746562696e2e636f6d2f514632557a6a56590a`.

It looks like hex so let's run it in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), we get back the following: [https://pastebin.com/QF2UzjVY](https://pastebin.com/QF2UzjVY). 

If we go to this link, we find this `T0tLIApSVEx7MTBiYmE5YTUyNDE3MDk1ZGU1MWRiOTQ1NjM2MWQ3NDR9Cg==` which is base64, let's run it again in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and we get the flag: `RTL{10bba9a52417095de51db9456361d744}`
